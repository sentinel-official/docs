The aim is to liberate ourselves from dependence on centralized entities, irrespective of their size, which often take a cut at every stage of the process. By redistributing power in a decentralized manner, every participant gains a voice, eliminating the need to place trust in intermediaries for facilitating exchanges. This critical distinction becomes evident when comparing a VPN (centralized) with a dVPN (decentralized VPN).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"glossary":{"id":"glossary","title":"Glossary","description":"Use this glossary to learn about terms used in Sentinel and the Cosmos ecosystem.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"governance":{"id":"governance","title":"Governance","description":"Governance refers to the decentralized decision-making process that allows stakeholders to collectively determine the direction and policies of the network. It involves proposing, discussing, and voting on changes, upgrades, and strategic decisions regarding the protocol, ecosystem development, and resource allocation. Through governance mechanisms, such as on-chain voting and proposal submission, participants can voice their opinions, contribute to shaping the network\'s evolution, and ensure its resilience, security, and sustainability. Effective governance fosters transparency, inclusivity, and accountability within the Sentinel DVPN ecosystem, empowering community members to actively participate in its management and growth.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/README":{"id":"introduction/README","title":"Introduction","description":"What is Sentinel?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction/sentinel-cosmos":{"id":"introduction/sentinel-cosmos","title":"Sentinel within Cosmos","description":"Cosmos unfolds as a dynamic ecosystem, a tapestry of interconnected applications and services meticulously crafted for a decentralized future.
