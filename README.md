<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator that helps you ship beautiful, accessible docs. For building our [documentation](https://trinityprivacy.github.io/sentinel-docs/) portal, we have made certain modifications over the template generated by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

### Built With

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This section describes how you can get our documentation portal up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/trinityprivacy/sentinel-docs
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Run the app

```sh
npm start
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

<!-- In usage, mention how to edit the docs, how to update versions, etc. -->

### To add new sections

Create a new section in docusaurus by adding a new section to `SECTIONS[]` array with the `defineSection()` utility easily.

Now, run `npm start` and you can access your 'new-section' at http://localhost:3000/new-section

### Adding new docs to the Context Switcher

To add a newly created section to the Sections Menu, edit [./src/sections.js](src/sections.js).

For example, for a section `new-section`, you will add:

```jsx
import { NewSectionIcon } from '../assets/icons';

const SECTIONS = [
  // ...
  {
    id: 'new-section',
    name: 'New Section',
    icon: NewSectionIcon,
    section: false, // Whether it has a section menu or not
  },
]
```

You'll need to create a NewSectionIcon component too.

That is it!
