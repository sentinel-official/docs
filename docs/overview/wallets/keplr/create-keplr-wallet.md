You can change the derivation path by clicking on `Advanced`, but this is optional and not suggested for how we are going to use Keplr.

Click on `I understood. Show my phrase` and you will see your mnemonic phrase. Write the words on paper and store them in a secure place. Avoid taking screenshots of the words or copying them into your computer/phone notes.
