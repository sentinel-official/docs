You can get P2P either from Centralized and Decentralized exchanges.

**Sentinel Foundation** recommend using:
- SwapFast: [https://swap.sentinel.co](https://swap.sentinel.co) built by Leap.

### Centralized Exchanges (CEX)

- Kucoin: [https://trade.kucoin.com/DVPN-USDT](https://trade.kucoin.com/DVPN-USDT)

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)

- Osmosis (best choice!): [https://app.osmosis.zone](https://app.osmosis.zone)
