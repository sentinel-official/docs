# P2P Coin

The P2P coin is a governance coin that allows staked coin holders to decide the future of the protocol, including every implementation detail. P2P coin revolves around its functions as a:

- **Payment for Bandwidth**: Users can utilize P2P coins to purchase bandwidth to access to dVPN services offered by the network's nodes, ensuring seamless and private internet connectivity.
    Users can pay for bandwidth in two ways:
    1. Pay-as-you go. Directly paying P2P to the node host for a set amount of bandwidth.
    2. Periodic subscription. User pays fiat to the app, and the app pays the node hosts in P2P on the users behalf on the backend. 
- **Revenue Sharing**: On top of the usual PoS staking rewards Sentinel's protocol enables revenue sharing from dVPN node owners. 20% of the earnings from dVPN node owners are also going to P2P stakers.
- **Staking**: P2P coins are used for staking within the Sentinel Network. Validators and delegators stake P2P coins to secure the network and participate in the consensus process. Validators are responsible for proposing and validating blocks, and they receive rewards in the form of P2P coins for their efforts.
- **Governance**: P2P coins are used for governance within the Sentinel Network. P2P holders can participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals related to network upgrades, protocol changes, funding allocations, and other matters that affect the ecosystem.
- **Transaction Fees**: P2P coins are used to pay for transaction fees within the Sentinel Network. When users perform actions such as sending coins or executing smart contracts on Sentinel Blockchain, they must pay a fee in P2P coins to the validators who process and validate those transactions.
