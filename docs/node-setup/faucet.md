# Node Faucet

When running your node, it is crucial to fund your opeator address with some DVPN to initiate the process. If you are only running it for testing purposes and do not wish to allocate 50 DVPN, you can utilize the Sentinel Node Faucet. Simply input your node operator address, and the faucet will dispatch 0.2 DVPNâ€”sufficient for testing the successful online status of your node. Following this, you may contemplate adding more DVPN to sustain its online presence for a longer duration.
