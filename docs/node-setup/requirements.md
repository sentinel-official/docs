# Requirements

Setting up and operating a dVPN node involves careful consideration of two crucial factors: the hosting location and hardware specifications.

## Hosting Location

Establishing a Sentinel dVPN node offers flexibility in choosing the location, tailored to diverse preferences and requirements. Options include:
- On a Virtual Private Server (VPS): select a provider (check this [list](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/5Exc+RslM-bhp301wGl6i0Ui/) of tested providers)
- At home: utilize a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 for a locally hosted solution.
- On Akash Network: Refer to the specific [guide](/node-setup/other/cloudmos-on-akash/start-cloudmos-on-akash) for detailed instructions

## Hardware Recommendations

While running a dVPN node requires minimal hardware, optimal performance is ensured with the following specifications:
- 2 CPUs
- 2GB RAM
- Unlimited bandwidth

These recommended hardware configurations ensure a smoother and more efficient operation of your dVPN node.
