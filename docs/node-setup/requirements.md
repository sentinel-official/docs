# Requirements

Setting up and operating a dVPN node involves careful consideration of two crucial factors: the hosting location and hardware specifications.

## Hosting Location

Establishing a Sentinel dVPN node offers flexibility in choosing the location, tailored to diverse preferences and requirements. Options include:
- On a Virtual Private Server (VPS): select a provider (check this [list](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/5Exc+RslM-bhp301wGl6i0Ui/) of tested providers)
- At home: utilize a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 for a locally hosted solution.
- On Akash Network: Refer to the specific [guide](/node-setup/akash) for detailed instructions

:::warning
It's recommended to avoid using widely known cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, Vultr, Linode, Oracle, Alibaba, ColoCrossing, Digital Ocean, and similar platforms, as they may not be whitelisted for dVPN nodes.

## Hardware Recommendations

While running a dVPN node requires minimal hardware, optimal performance is ensured with the following specifications:
- vCPU: 2
- RAM: 2GB
- Hard Drive: 10GB SSD
- Operative System: Linux (preferably Debian or Ubuntu)
- Bandwidth: Unmetered

These recommended hardware configurations ensure a smoother and more efficient operation of your dVPN node.
