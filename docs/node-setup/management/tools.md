Explore the Sentinel Ecosystem with the following tools designed to facilitate seamless navigation through all nodes and discover specific details about each one.

- [Node Map](https://map.sentinel.co): a global map displaying all nodes across the world.
- [Node Dashboard](https://nodes.sentinel.co): access node details, including location, earnings, provided bandwidth, active subscriptions and sessions. The dashboard also indicates whether a node has successfully passed the health check
- [Busurnode Website](https://sentinel.busurnode.com/): this tool assists node hosts in obtaining information about their nodes' health check status. In case of failure, it provides details about what might have gone wrong.
- [Node Faucet](https://faucet.im/): To kickstart your node, ensure your operator address has sufficient DVPN. For testing, use the Sentinel Node Faucet by entering your node operator address. The faucet will send 0.2 DVPN, ample for verifying your node's online status. Consider adding more DVPN for prolonged online presence.
