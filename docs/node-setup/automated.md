# Automated Setup

To simplify the installation of a dVPN node, you can employ a `.deb` package tool called dVPN Node Manager that automates the process through an intuitive user interface (UI).

This tool is available on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sentinelgrowthdao/dvpn-node-manager), and a comprehensive article has also been published on [dvpn.news](https://dvpn.news), providing detailed instructions.

The dVPN  Node Manager tool can be installed in three distinct ways, tailored to your specific requirements.

## Installation via PPA (Personal Package Archive)

For Debian-based users, the simplest and most streamlined way of installing the `dvpn-node-manager` is through our Personal Package Archive (PPA). This method ensures that you receive the latest updates automatically and simplifies the installation process.

### Adding the PPA and Installing the Package

Add the PPA to your system: This step adds our repository to your system's list of sources, from which packages are retrieved. You can add the PPA by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:foxinou/dvpn-node-manager
sudo apt update
```

### Install the dvpn-node-manager:

Now that your system is aware of the new repository, you can install the `dvpn-node-manager` package by executing:

```bash
sudo apt install dvpn-node-manager
```

This command will download and install the `dvpn-node-manager` along with all required dependencies automatically.

### Running the dVPN Node Manager

Once the installation is complete, you can run the `dvpn-node-manager` using the following command:

```bash
sudo dvpn-node-manager
```

This will launch the dVPN Node Manager interface, allowing you to manage your dVPN node's settings and operations directly through a simple command-line interface.

### Uninstalling the Package

If you wish to uninstall the dVPN Node Manager, you can do so by executing:

```bash
sudo apt remove dvpn-node-manager
```

This command will remove the dvpn-node-manager package from your system. If you also want to remove the PPA from your list of software sources, use:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:foxinou/dvpn-node-manager
```

This will ensure that your system no longer checks for updates from the dvpn-node-manager PPA.


## From Debian Package 

For users on Debian-based systems, the `dvpn-node-manager` is available as a `.deb` package, which simplifies the installation process and automatically installs all required dependencies.

### Downloading the Package

You can manually download the `.deb` file of your choice by consulting the available [releases](https://github.com/sentinelgrowthdao/dvpn-node-manager/releases).

```bash
sudo wget -O /var/cache/apt/archives/dvpn-node-manager_latest.deb https://github.com/sentinelgrowthdao/dvpn-node-manager/releases/download/v1.0.0-alpha9/dvpn-node-manager_1.0.0-alpha9_$(dpkg --print-architecture).deb
sudo chmod 644 /var/cache/apt/archives/dvpn-node-manager_latest.deb
sudo chown _apt:root /var/cache/apt/archives/dvpn-node-manager_latest.deb
```

### Installing the Package

After manually downloading the `.deb` package, launch the installation using the `apt` package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install /var/cache/apt/archives/dvpn-node-manager_latest.deb
```

This command will install the dvpn-node-manager script and all necessary dependencies on your system. The package takes care of setting up everything needed for the script to run.

### Running the Script

Running the script using the `dvpn-node-manager` command:

```bash
sudo dvpn-node-manager
```

This command will launch the dVPN Node Manager, allowing you to manage your dVPN node's settings and operations directly through a simple command-line interface.

### Uninstalling the Package

If you wish to uninstall the dVPN Node Manager, you can do so by executing:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove /var/cache/apt/archives/dvpn-node-manager_latest.deb
```

This command will remove the dvpn-node-manager package from your system, as well as all configurations, docker images and containers.


## From Source

To install the script from source, follow the steps below:

### Downloading the Script

Download the script using the `curl` command:


```bash
curl -o $HOME/dvpn-node-manager.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sentinelgrowthdao/dvpn-node-manager/main/dvpn-node-manager.sh
```
### Set execution permissions

Grant execution permissions to the script using the chmod command:

```bash
chmod +x dvpn-node-manager.sh
```

### Running the Script

Execute the script using the sudo bash command:

```bash
sudo bash dvpn-node-manager.sh
```

Follow the installation process as indicated by the interface. If Docker is not already installed on the machine, it will be installed followed by a system reboot.

Restarting the script after installation will allow for modifying settings and managing the wallet or node.
