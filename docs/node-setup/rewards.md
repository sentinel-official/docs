# dVPN Node Rewards

For [hosting a dVPN node](/node-setup) there are currently 2 known reward systems:
- The base reward
- The bonus incentive reward

**The base reward**
Running a dVPN node brings with it costs for the owner. Think about costs for buying hardware and paying the electricity bill. Or paying the VPS provider. In return there is a reward system in place that is market based. So how does it work? You set the price per GB and per hour. Depending if the customer is paying per used GB or has a subscription it will use one of those set prices. From here the base reward depends on 2 things:
- How high do you set the price for customers to use your node as their dVPN.
- How much do customers use your node as their dVPN.

This will create a market for using a dVPN and strike a balance between the quality/performance of a node vs the price set by the owner. Setting the price too high will get you less customers and setting it too low will cut some of your profits.

**The bonus incentive reward**
This bonus incentive reward is called the “Node Incentive Program”. For more information on how to be eligible for this reward see our [blog](https://medium.com/sentinel/retroactive-node-rewards-and-restarting-the-node-incentive-program-bae48ade7319).
