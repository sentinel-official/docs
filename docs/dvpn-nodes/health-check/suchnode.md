Suchnode is a node dashboard created by a community member going by Teneke, an infrastructure expert and strong advocate for dVPN nodes.

Visit the [Suchnode Website](https://suchnode.net) to explore detailed statistics for individual nodes such as health check status, payouts and whitelisting, as well as the overall network.

You can easily filter nodes using the checkboxes or by typing in the search bar.
