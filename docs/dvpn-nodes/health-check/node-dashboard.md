In the [Node Dashboard](https://nodes.sentinel.co) each node features an indicator on the page, clearly indicating whether it has successfully passed the health check or not. Simply paste your `sentnode` address into the search bar. Furthermore, an alert system will be implemented to promptly notify node operators in the event that their node fails a health check, providing them with timely and actionable information.
