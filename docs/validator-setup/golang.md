# Install Golang

First of all install some required packages

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y curl git jq make unzip
```

You now have two methods for installing Golang.

## Ubuntu

To install Go on Ubuntu, you can easily follow the steps provided.

Add the repository

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports
```

Install Golang

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y golang-go
```

## Manually

This method should work on all Linux systems, although it is intended for more experienced users.

Get a copy of the [last](https://go.dev/dl/) Golang version and unpack it

```bash
cd ~ && \
curl -OL https://golang.org/dl/goX.X.X.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
tar -C ${HOME} -xvf goX.X.X.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Move the extracted go into `/usr/local/lib/go`
```bash
sudo mv ${HOME}/go /usr/local/lib/go
```

## Export Golang environment variables

Now that you've successfully installed Golang, it's essential to configure its environmental variables.

Open the .bashrc file

```bash
nano ${HOME}/.bashrc
```

Based on your installation type, set the GOROOT environment variable by choosing one of the following lines

```bash
# For Ubuntu installation
export GOROOT=/usr/lib/go

# For Manual installation
export GOROOT=/usr/local/lib/go
```

After setting the appropriate GOROOT environment variable, you can add the following lines

```bash title="${HOME}/.bashrc"
export GOPATH=${HOME}/go
export GOBIN=${GOPATH}/bin
export PATH=${PATH}:${GOROOT}/bin:${GOBIN}
```

Source the file to reflect changes in the current Terminal session.

```bash
source ${HOME}/.bashrc
```
