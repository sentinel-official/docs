# Node Setup on Akash Network

### Overview & Requirements

You can also contribute to the Sentinel Network by sharing your bandwidth through the setup of a dVPN node on the Akash Network, a decentralized open-source cloud computing platform. By doing so, you promote greater privacy and decentralization compared to using VPS.

Before deploying your Sentinel Node on Akash, you need to install the [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) Extension in your browser (available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keplr/)).

Then open Keplr, create a new wallet and take note of the mnemonic (24 words)

Access this [website](https://www.base64encode.org/), encode your mnemonic in Base64 format and take note of it as you will need to insert it into the template file

To get started, fund your wallet with the following minimum amounts:

- **50 P2P:**  necessary for the Node to operate
- **0.5 AKT:** required as a deployment deposit.
- **X AKT:** make sure you have enough AKT to cover your provider's monthly fees.

This is just an example of how your wallet is displayed

Your wallet is now set, and you can proceed with the Node deployment.
