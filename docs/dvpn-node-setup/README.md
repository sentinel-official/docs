# Sentinel dVPN Node Setup Guide

## Overview

If you want to contribute to the Sentinel network and share your internet bandwidth, you can set up a dVPN node that runs on the Sentinel protocol. Each node operator can set their own price for users who connect through their node. It’s then up to users to choose which node they want to use for their dVPN connection.

Setting up a dVPN node doesn’t require advanced Linux knowledge, just some basic familiarity. The process is straightforward and easy to follow. We recommend having at least **50 P2P** in your node account, as a small amount is periodically used to send a transaction to the blockchain to confirm that your node is still active.

There are currenty 2 ways to get started with setting up a dVPN node:

- [Manual](dvpn-node-setup/manual-setup)
- [Automated](/dvpn-node-setup/automated)
