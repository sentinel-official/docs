# Requirements

Setting up and operating a dVPN node involves careful consideration of two crucial factors: the hosting location and hardware specifications.

## Hosting Location

Establishing a Sentinel dVPN node offers flexibility in choosing the location, tailored to diverse preferences and requirements. Options include:
- On a Virtual Private Server (VPS): select a provider (check this [list](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/5Exc+RslM-bhp301wGl6i0Ui/) of tested providers)
- At home: utilize a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 for a locally hosted solution.
- On Akash Network: a new updated guide is being created following the hub upgrade v12

:::warning
It's recommended to avoid using widely known cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, Vultr, Linode, Oracle, Alibaba, ColoCrossing, Digital Ocean, and other highly-saturated providers, as they may not be whitelisted for dVPN nodes.

## Hardware Recommendations

While running a dVPN node requires minimal hardware, optimal performance is ensured with the following specifications:
- vCPU: 2 x 2GHz
- RAM: 2GB
- Hard Drive: Minimum 10GB SSD
- Operative System: Linux (preferably Debian or Ubuntu)
- Bandwidth: Unmetered
- Network: Public IP address required for node operation

These recommended hardware configurations ensure a smoother and more efficient operation of your dVPN node.
