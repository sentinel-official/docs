## Node Configuration

## Set the Variables

Before creating the configuration files, set up a few variables by running the following commands:

```bash
# Define application directory
# Define application directory
APP_DIR="${HOME}/.sentinel-dvpnx"

# Get your public IP addresses
MY_IPv4_ADDR=$(curl --silent ipv4.icanhazip.com 2>/dev/null)
MY_IPv6_ADDR=$(curl --silent ipv6.icanhazip.com 2>/dev/null)

REMOTE_ADDRS_FLAGS=()
if [ -n "${MY_IPv4_ADDR}" ]; then REMOTE_ADDRS_FLAGS+=("--node.remote-addrs" \"${MY_IPv4_ADDR}\"); fi
if [ -n "${MY_IPv6_ADDR}" ]; then REMOTE_ADDRS_FLAGS+=("--node.remote-addrs" \"${MY_IPv6_ADDR}\"); fi

# Set Docker volume mapping
VOLUME="${APP_DIR}:/root/.sentinel-dvpnx"

# Set key name for transactions
TX_FROM_NAME="key-1"

# Display configuration for verification
echo "App Directory: $APP_DIR"
echo "Public IPv4: $MY_IPv4_ADDR"
echo "Public IPv6: $MY_IPv6_ADDR"
echo "Key Name: $TX_FROM_NAME"
```

You should see something like this:

```text
App Directory: /home/<you_user>/.sentinel-dvpnx
Public IPv4: <your_ip>
Key Name: key-1
```

## Initialize the Configuration

The following command creates the configuration files, which you can later customise.

Be sure to choose your preferred node type using the `--node.service-type` flag â€” options are `wireguard`, `v2ray`, or `openvpn`.

```bash
sudo docker run \
  --rm \
  --volume "${VOLUME}" \
  sentinel-dvpnx init \
  --keyring.backend "test" \
  --node.service-type "wireguard" \
  --tx.from-name "${TX_FROM_NAME}" \
  "${REMOTE_ADDRS_FLAGS[@]}"
```

Expected output:

```text
Validating configuration
Writing app config file=/root/.sentinel-dvpnx/config.toml
Initializing PKI with CA certificate and key dir=/root/.sentinel-dvpnx
Issuing certificate and key name=tls
Initializing service force=false type=wireguard
Configuration initialized successfully
```

## Add a Mnemonic

Now, add the account key specified in your `config.toml` file:

```bash
sudo docker run \
  --rm \
  --volume "${VOLUME}" \
  --interactive \
  --tty \
  sentinel-dvpnx keys add "${TX_FROM_NAME}"
```

You can either enter your existing BIP-39 mnemonic or generate a new one by pressing Enter.
Youâ€™ll then be prompted for an optional passphrase (press Enter again to skip).

This will generate an operator address (starting with `sent1`) and a mnemonic phrase.
Write the mnemonic down and store it securely, **youâ€™ll need it to recover your key**.

## Enable Firewall Ports

### Detect Required Ports Automatically

You can automatically find all the ports your node needs with:

```bash
# Automatically detect and configure required ports
PUBLISH_PORT_ARGS=$(find "${APP_DIR}" -name "config.toml" -exec tomljson {} \; |
  jq -sr '[.[] | .. | objects | to_entries[] | select(.key == "port" or (.key | endswith("_port"))) | .value] |
  flatten | unique | map("-p \(.):\(.)/tcp -p \(.):\(.)/udp") | join(" ")')

# Verify port configuration
echo "Port arguments: $PUBLISH_PORT_ARGS"
```

Example output:

```text
Port arguments: -p 11608:11608/tcp -p 11608:11608/udp -p 13860:13860/tcp -p 13860:13860/udp -p 19781:19781/tcp -p 19781:19781/udp -p 25068:25068/tcp -p 25068:25068/udp -p 54556:54556/tcp -p 54556:54556/udp
```

If youâ€™re using zsh, also run:

```bash
PUBLISH_PORT_ARGS=("${(@s/ /)PUBLISH_PORT_ARGS}")
```

### Open the Ports with UFW

Once you have the required ports, open them in your firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 11608,13860,19781,25068,54556/tcp
sudo ufw allow 11608,13860,19781,25068,54556/udp
```

## Enable Port Forwarding (for Residential Nodes)

If youâ€™re running your node from home, youâ€™ll need to enable port forwarding on your router so others can connect to it.

In your routerâ€™s WAN settings, add entries like this:

```bash
Name            ProtocolWAN     Port                    LAN port                Destination IP
TCP_PORT        TCP             <tcp_port>              <tcp_port>              your_local_ip
WIREGUARD_PORT  UDP             <wireguard_udp_port>    <wireguard_udp_port>    your_local_ip
V2RAY_PORT      TCP             <v2ray_tcp_port>        <v2ray_tcp_port>        your_local_ip
```
