# Introduction

:::tip Ticker Change
Sentinel's ticker has changed from "$DVPN" to "$P2P." dVPN News has also rebranded as P2P News to reflect the project's broader scope.

##  What is Sentinel?

Sentinel (ticker: $P2P, formerly $DVPN) is a layer-one peer-to-peer bandwidth marketplace DePIN blockchain which is used to power services like decentralized VPNs (dVPNs) and training data acquisition for AI models.

Anybody can host a node on the proof-of-stake Sentinel blockchain (built on the Cosmos SDK) and sell bandwidth to tens of thousands of real-world users across the world.

The purpose of the Sentinel ecosystem is to empower universal access to the internet in a trusted and provable manner. This will be done by allowing organizations and individuals around the world to construct decentralized, scalable, distributed networking solutions on Sentinel’s Cosmos-based blockchain in a cost-effective manner.

We strongly encourage all interested parties to build on Sentinel—anyone from established VPN companies to startups to lone individuals in their bedroom. Sentinel's code is fully open-sourced, transparent, and readily available to all for this very reason.

## Why Sentinel?

### Decentralized

A decentralized VPN (dVPN) is not owned or operated by any single centralized actor. With a dVPN, there is no need to place your trust and data in the hands of a big tech company to guarantee reliability, as all authority is distributed across the blockchain to various node owners, stakers, application developers, and validators.

### Open Source

Open-sourcing the code substantially decreases the risk of security breaches. Sentinel's transparency means that innumerable knowledgeable, experienced individuals have reviewed its functionality, identified vulnerabilities, and contributed to its improvement—and will continue to do so! 

### No Log Policy

dVPN is a trustless technology; which means you don't have to just take our word for it when we say that Sentinel is absolutely committed to user privacy, and does not log any user activity or data—it's impossible for us to in the first place.


## Sentinel in the Cosmos Ecosystem

Cosmos unfolds as a dynamic ecosystem, a tapestry of interconnected applications and services meticulously crafted for a decentralized future. At its core, Cosmos stands as a decentralized network, comprising independent parallel blockchains fortified by Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms, such as the revered [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com) consensus.

In essence, Cosmos materializes as a vibrant ecosystem of blockchains designed for seamless scalability and interoperability. Pre-Cosmos, blockchains languished in isolation, incapable of meaningful communication. Hindered by developmental complexities, they struggled with paltry transaction throughput. Cosmos introduces a novel technical paradigm to surmount these challenges, prompting a return to the foundational principles of blockchain technology.

### How does Sentinel fit in?

Within the Cosmos Ecosystem, Sentinel has ingeniously fashioned its own blockchain. It is not merely a standalone entity but rather a beneficiary of Cosmos' inherent advantages, enabling scalability and cross-blockchain communication, thus achieving true interoperability. A tangible manifestation of this advantage is evident in the seamless trading of P2P with other cryptocurrencies on disparate blockchains. This decentralized exchange (DEX) capability is exemplified by platforms like [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/?from=DVPN&to=ATOM), an integral part of the Cosmos Ecosysten. Osmosis operates as a DEX with its own blockchain, yet it facilitates effortless P2P trading without the need for a bridging mechanism. Sentinel, nestled within Cosmos, exemplifies the harmonious coexistence and collaboration that define this decentralized cosmos.
