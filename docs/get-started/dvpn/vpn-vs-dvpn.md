Since the advent of the crypto revolution, the pursuit of decentralization has remained a fundamental goal. The aim is to liberate ourselves from dependence on centralized entities, irrespective of their size, which often take a cut at every stage of the process. By redistributing power in a decentralized manner, every participant gains a voice, eliminating the need to place trust in intermediaries for facilitating exchanges. This critical distinction becomes evident when comparing a VPN (centralized) with a dVPN (decentralized VPN).

Why do individuals opt for a VPN in the first place?

- Seeking anonymity on the internet?
- Wishing to alter GEO location?
- Enhancing web surfing security?

For all these reasons and more, choosing a dVPN over a traditional VPN is preferable. Conventional VPNs are controlled by centralized organizations that own the servers and hardware through which your internet activities pass. They possess knowledge of your identity, location, and internet usage patterns, as all your data flows through their network. Can you be certain they do not maintain logs? Are they genuinely secure? What if they fall victim to a cyber attack, putting sensitive data from thousands or millions of users at risk? Can you trust that these centralized organizations are not selling your data?

In contrast, a dVPN is not owned by a single centralized entity, and Sentinel's code is entirely open source. By opening up the code to public scrutiny, the risk of hacking is significantly reduced, as a community of skilled individuals can identify vulnerabilities and contribute to its improvement. Simultaneously, the transparent nature of the Sentinel software ensures that no logs are kept. Even if a single node were to be compromised (not through the Sentinel software itself), the impact is confined to that particular node, safeguarding everyone else. With multiple relay nodes, each owned by different individuals, no single entity possesses the complete metadata of your requests.

In essence, a dVPN negates the necessity to trust a centralized organization, as its power is distributed across the blockchain or various node owners. By choosing a dVPN, you liberate yourself from reliance on a singular organization, securing your freedom as a service beyond the constraints of the centralized world.
