# Sentinel dVPN Full Node Setup Guide

This guide is intended for anyone who wishes to contribute to the Sentinel Network by installing a Full Node .

A full node is a participant in the network that maintains a complete copy of the blockchain.
It stores the entire transaction history of the blockchain and validates new transactions based on the consensus rules of the network.
Full nodes are important for decentralization as they help in distributing the blockchain data across the network, making it more resilient.

A Sentinel dVPN Full Node can be deployed on various platforms, including:
- Dedicated server (as explained in this guide)
- Your home setup
- The Akash Network

To set up a Full Node successfully, you should possess a moderate level of proficiency in Linux and networking. This guide has been designed to assist users in comprehending all the necessary steps required for setting up a full node.

### dVPN node

If running a Sentinel Full Node seems to be unfeasible for you, you can also setup a dVPN node instead and provide bandwidth to the ecosystem. It will still support the Sentinel network and can be a source of income as well. Read more about it in the [dVPN node setup](/node-setup) section.
