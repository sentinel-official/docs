Things you can do with buf Studio: 
- Select an endpoint from any BSR module to send requests to gRPC
- Use the editor with schema-based autocompletion, validation and documentation to draft JSON based request messages.
- Configure headers to further customize outgoing requests.
- Optionally include cookies in outgoing request to send authenticated requests to private APIs (or Buf Studio Agent instances).
- Create shareable links for requests defined on Buf Studio to team members with access.

#### How does buf Studio work with Sentinel
