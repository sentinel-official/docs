## Interacting with the gRPC Server

As described on the [Network page](../../networks). A gRPC endpoint is availble on the public Osmosis nodes so that you can start playing and intreacting with it right away.

## Enabling gRPC on a node
If you are running your own node. It's also possible to enable them by editing  `~/.osmosisd/config/app.toml`: 

* `grpc.enable = true|false` field defines if the gRPC server should be enabled. Defaults to `true`.
* `grpc.address = {string}` field defines the address (really, the port, since the host should be kept at `0.0.0.0`) the server should bind to. Defaults to `0.0.0.0:9090`.



### Grpc endpoints
An overview of all available gRPC endpoints shipped with Osmosis is available in the [Osmosis Protobuf documentation](https://buf.build/osmosis-labs/osmosis). There is also a Cosmos SDK is [Protobuf documentation](https://buf.build/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

You can send requests to the gRPC server using a gRPC client such as [grpcurl](#grpcurl) or from [Buf Studio](./interact-grpc-buf-studio).


Since the code generation library largely depends on your own tech stack, we will only present three alternatives:
