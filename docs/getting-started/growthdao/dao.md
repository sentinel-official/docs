# Sentinel Growth DAO

The Growth DAO manages the community fund and take the lead on various campaigns including, but not limited to:
- Governance Structure 
- Community engagement from a community perspective 
- White-label dVPN development funding
- Marketing and Partnerships
- Research and Development


## Governance Structure

The Growth DAO is governed by willing representatives who have contributed towards Sentinel in the past, each with a voting share in the DAO. Decisions will be reached through a majority consensus. All actions, discussions, and voting will be recorded in the usual manner, i.e., Commonwealth or published minutes.


## Community Engagement Initiative

Funds are allocated to host regular interactive events such as AMAs, developer workshops, community voting, and community-involved content that includes provisions for technical guides and submissions to things like the Sentinel Knowledge base. 
The purpose is to build a strong, engaged community that can contribute to the growth and development of Sentinel.


## White-label dVPN development funding

Within the DAO, a dedicated funding pool is commissioned and specifically designed to support projects that would yield positive results for the Sentinel dVPN framework. For example, the DAO committee could prioritize funding requests for projects that would:
- Provide financial support for developing and launching new white-labeled dVPN products.
- Provide marketing and promotional support for white labels, increase overall awareness, and ultimately, market share for the Sentinel Network. 
- Develop new features for the Sentinel dVPN framework that make the white labeling process easier.


## Marketing 

The DAO is the main flag holders for the product.

- Content marketing: the DAO invests in creating high-quality content that educates potential users about the Sentinel dVPN framework, its products, its mission, and values. 
- Social Media Engagement: leverage the community's support to promote and champion a network on various social media platforms, similar to an ambassador program. This involves coordinating with community members for specific social campaigns without resorting to unethical practices like raiding or astroturfing, ultimately strengthening the network's online presence and reputation.
- SEO: Using specific keywords and links to highlight Sentinel and its products with messaging. 
- Influencer partnerships: Getting referral codes known and shared, further collaborations on using Sentinel dVPN. Imagine your favorite YouTuber shilling their own custom VPN (built on Sentinel) instead of Nord or Express VPN. - This is the type of brand capture we need. 
- Conferences and Events: Now the nature of Sentinel is privacy, Imagine sponsoring an event and providing free dVPN services for everyone at the event. We need people to experience the product, download it for themselves, use it, then refer others to it. 


## Partnerships

The primary goal of forming a partnership is to enhance and advance a project. To achieve this, we aim to leverage growth tools such as Galxe, Disco, Quest engine, or other options we prefer. We should also consider transitioning to established platforms like Product Hunt. These tools and partnerships will play a crucial role in promoting Sentinel and positioning it as a strong competitor against traditional VPN providers.


## Integration Partnerships

Creating a rewarding system within a community encourages people to identify opportunities for technical integration, motivating their efforts. One example of this is forming partnerships with educational institutions or online learning platforms to promote the mission and blockchain technology of The DAO.


## Research and Development

The DAO conducts research and initiates development projects that are in line with the objectives of the Sentinel DVPN project. For instance, in order to secure a substantial portion of the multi-billion dollar VPN market, Sentinel needs to create or host new dVPN applications and various tools that enhance user engagement. This may encompass:

- The development of a native wallet app for DVPN.
- Enhancements to current tools such as Network Stats and Node Explorer pages.
- The creation of tools for node hosting and node launching.
- The establishment of a routing protocol to enhance network security.
- The design and implementation of other management tools focused on providing maximum user-friendliness.


These tools would simplify the usage of the Sentinel network, thereby enhancing its ability to attract and retain users. Furthermore, they would contribute to enhancing the network's performance and security, making it more appealing to developers and investors alike. Through strategic investments in development, Sentinel can foster a thriving ecosystem of dVPN applications and tools, benefiting both users and the overall growth of the DAO.


## Funding

The DAO is funded with coins from the community fund, approximately 240,000,000 coins, to support the implementation of these initiatives. The precise amount will be determined based on the requirements and the scope of our operations, subject to approval by DAO members. A multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet has been established and will be under the supervision of DAO members.
