## Introduction

LeapÂ is an advanced "super wallet" for the Cosmos ecosystem, with the goal of providing a top-notch user experience tailored for Cosmos users. Available as mobile apps for iOS and Android and as a browser extension, Leap allows you to explore Injective and over 50 other Cosmos ecosystem chains. Users can transfer and exchange assets between wallets, earn staking rewards, participate in governance, transfer assets over IBC, manage NFTs, and much more, all from within the wallet app!


## Why Leap?

Private keys are stored locally. This removes the friction and risk of web pages having to manage user private keys safely and securely.

As the user's private key is not managed by the website, users do not have to worry about the level of security of the website. The user only has to trust the security guarantees of Leap, and freely interact with various web applications as they wish (and verify the contents of the transaction).

## Getting Started

Additionally, we've prepared a concise, step-by-step guide for your convenience. Just keep exploring!

Pay attention to the websites you connect your Leap wallet to and only download Leap from the official website or from the link you can find in this tutorial. The same principle applies to any other wallet.

No one from Cosmos and Leap team will ever write you in a DM asking to validate your wallet or type your mnemonics:
Please be careful of scammers and if you need help always use public channels.
You are your own bank: help us in assisting you in keeping it safe.
