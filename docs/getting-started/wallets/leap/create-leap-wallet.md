# Create Leap Wallet

## How to create a new Account via Manemonic/Seed Phrase

When you open the app or extension, you will be presented with three options: create a new wallet, import an existing Keplr or Cosmostation wallet, or import using a seed phrase. Choose the option to create a new wallet.

You will be shown a secret recovery phrase. Make sure to save this phrase in a safe and secure location, as it is the only way to recover your wallet. Do not share this phrase with anyone.

Your wallet is now set up and ready to use. You can access it by clicking on the LEAP wallet icon in your browser's toolbar. If you are using Chrome, the icon will be located in the top right corner of your browser. If you cannot find the icon, look for a "puzzle piece" icon and click on it to access a list of installed extensions. There, you should find LEAP wallet and you can click on the "pin icon" to pin it to your toolbar for easy access in the future.
