You will be prompted with your mnemonic phrase. Please write it down on a piece of paper and store it in a secure location. Refrain from taking screenshots or copying the words into your computer or phone notes.

You can change the derivation path by clicking on `HD path setting`, but this is optional and not suggested for how we are going to use Cosmostation.
If you are interested in knowing more about the HD wallet derivation path, you can find more [here](https://guide.cosmostation.io/web_wallet_en.html).
