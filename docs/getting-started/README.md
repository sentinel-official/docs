# Introduction

##  What is Sentinel?

Sentinel is a web3 framework providing a community driven network of nodes that share their bandwidth, on which Decentralized VPNs and other such services are built. The purpose of the Sentinel ecosystem is to empower universal access to the internet in a trusted and provable manner. This will be done by allowing organizations and individuals around the world to construct cost-effective, scalable, distributed and decentralized networking solutions on Sentinelâ€™s Cosmos-based blockchain.

:::info Important 
Sentinel is a network of independent dVPN (decentralized virtual private network) applications, not just a single consumer facing dVPN.
:::

Apart from releasing and maintaining the native Sentinel application on Desktop, Android and iOS other organizations will be able to utilize the power of the Sentinel blockchain by using the Sentinel Protocol. Sentinel strongly encourages other organizations to white-label the Sentinel protocol as the code is fully open sourced and transparant.

## Why Sentinel?

### Decentralized
A decentralized VPN (dVPN) is not owned by a single centralized organization. With a dVPN, there is no need to place trust in a centralized entity to guarantee its reliability, as all that authority is distributed across the blockchain or various node owners. By using a dVPN, you attain freedom from the world, including the organization that previously supplied you with this liberating service.

### Open Source
The Sentinel's code is completely open source. Open-sourcing the code substantially decreases the risk of hacking because numerous smart and knowledgeable individuals can review its functionality, identify vulnerabilities, and contribute to its improvement.

### No Log Policy
Sentinel dVPN is committed to user privacy and does not log any user activity or data.
