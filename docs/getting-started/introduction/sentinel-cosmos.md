# Sentinel in the Cosmos Ecosystem

Cosmos unfolds as a dynamic ecosystem, a tapestry of interconnected applications and services meticulously crafted for a decentralized future. At its core, Cosmos stands as a decentralized network, comprising independent parallel blockchains fortified by Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms, such as the revered [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com) consensus.

In essence, Cosmos materializes as a vibrant ecosystem of blockchains designed for seamless scalability and interoperability. Pre-Cosmos, blockchains languished in isolation, incapable of meaningful communication. Hindered by developmental complexities, they struggled with paltry transaction throughput. Cosmos introduces a novel technical paradigm to surmount these challenges, prompting a return to the foundational principles of blockchain technology.

### How does Sentinel fit in?

Within the Cosmos Ecosystem, Sentinel has ingeniously fashioned its own blockchain. It is not merely a standalone entity but rather a beneficiary of Cosmos' inherent advantages, enabling scalability and cross-blockchain communication, thus achieving true interoperability. A tangible manifestation of this advantage is evident in the seamless trading of DVPN with other cryptocurrencies on disparate blockchains. This decentralized exchange (DEX) capability is exemplified by platforms like [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/?from=DVPN&to=ATOM), an integral part of the Cosmos Ecosysten. Osmosis operates as a DEX with its own blockchain, yet it facilitates effortless DVPN trading without the need for a bridging mechanism. Sentinel, nestled within Cosmos, exemplifies the harmonious coexistence and collaboration that define this decentralized cosmos.
