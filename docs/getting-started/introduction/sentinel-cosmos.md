# Sentinel within Cosmos

Cosmos is an ever-expanding ecosystem of interconnected apps and services, built for a decentralized future. Strictly speaking, Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by BFT consensus algorithms like [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com) consensus.

In other words, Cosmos is an ecosystem of blockchains that can scale and interoperate with each other. Before Cosmos, blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. They were hard to build and could only handle a small amount of transactions per second. Cosmos solves these problems with a new technical vision. In order to understand this vision we need to go back to the fundamentals of blockchain technology.

### How does Sentinel fit in?
Sentinel has created their own blockchain within the Cosmos ecosystem. Therefore it’s not only a blockchain on itself, but also utilized the benefits that Cosmos has to offer where it’s able to scale and communicate with other blockchains (being interoperable). A direct implementation of such a benefit is the ease within we are able to trade DVPN with other coins on other blockchains in a decentralized manner through for example [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/?from=DVPN&to=ATOM). Osmosis is a DEX that also has their own blockchain within Cosmos. However, DVPN can easily be traded there without the need for a bridge.
