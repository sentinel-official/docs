# Staking / Delegating

Delegating your DVPN can be accomplished through various methods, facilitated by one of the [Sentinel wallets](/getting-started/wallets).

You have the option to delegate your DVPN directly within the wallet itself or explore additional staking options through third-party websites. An excellent example is [restake.app](https://restake.app/sentinel), accessible through the Keplr wallet, which not only allows for direct interaction but also provides automatic compounding of your stake.

When delegating your stake, it is crucial to meticulously [choose a validator](/getting-started/staking-delegating/choose-validator) whom you trust with your assets. It's essential to note that the validator will never own your stake, ensuring you retain full control. However, selecting a reputable validator is paramount to minimizing slashing penalties and supporting entities that contribute value to the blockchain and enhance the overall Sentinel ecosystem.
