# Staking / Delegating

Delegating can be done in various ways through one of the [Sentinel wallets](/getting-started/wallets).

You can either delegate your DVPN directly from within the wallet directly or use a 3rd party website that offers more staking options. For example [restake.app](https://restake.app/sentinel) (which you can interact with through the Keplr wallet as well), offers automatic compounding of your stake.

Do make sure while you are delegating your stake you have carefully [selected a validator](/getting-started/staking-delegating/choose-validator) to trust your stake with. They will never own your stake and you keep being the only one having full control, however it's still important to select a good validator to minimize slashing penalties and support those that bring value to the blockchain and Sentinel overall.
