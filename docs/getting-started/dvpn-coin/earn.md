You can earn DVPN either through Staking and Node Revenue Sharing

## Staking

In Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, such as the Sentinel chain, you have the opportunity to stake your coins. By staking, you contribute to the security and operation of the network, and in return, you earn additional coins as rewards. These rewards come from a combination of inflation and transaction fees generated within the network. 

To determine the current Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for staking on the Sentinel chain, you can refer to the onchain metrics section of this page: [Mintscan - Sentinel](https://www.mintscan.io/sentinel). This APR reflects the rate at which your staked coins will grow over the course of a year, providing you with valuable insight into the potential returns of your staking activities.


## Revenue Sharing: Empowering Sentinel Protocol

In addition to the standard PoS staking rewards, Sentinel Protocol introduces an innovative revenue-sharing model for dVPN node owners. This mechanism ensures that 20% of all payments made to Node Hosts for bandwidth, whether through pay-as-you-go or periodic subscriptions, is distributed among DVPN stakers. This practice, known as [Node Revenue System](/nodes/earnings), not only fosters community involvement but also ensures that staking rewards are proportional to the network's adoption and usage. The remaining 80% of the payment is retained by the node host, incentivizing their participation and commitment to the network's growth. This innovative approach aligns the interests of all stakeholders and paves the way for sustainable expansion.
