# Ecoinomics

After dedicating a considerable amount of time to the Ethereum testnet blockchain, we have transitioned to Cosmos and established our own blockchain seamlessly integrated into the Cosmos network. This transition not only marks a shift in our technological infrastructure but also brings about a transformation in our ecoinomics.

Key metrics:
- Current supply: 25.93B
- Bonded DVPNs: 18.18B
- Max Supply: 48B
- Inflation rate: 14.92%

## Target Monthly Inflation Rate

The Sentinel coin ($DVPN) inflation will follow a structured approach, organized into epochs lasting 6 months each. Following each epoch, the inflation rate will diminish by 6%, akin to a halving mechanism. Commencing with a genesis rate of 49% (equivalent to a monthly rate of 4.0833% during the first epoch), this model persists until blockchain validation rewards attain a 13% annualized inflation. Subsequently, a constant decay model, implemented on a per-block basis, will govern inflation. This decay model progressively reduces inflation to approach zero, ultimately aligning with the Sentinel chain's maximum hard cap of 48 billion coins.
