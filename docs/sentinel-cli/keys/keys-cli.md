# Basic Key Management

As you have now built Sentinel CLI, you can manage your keys.

## Create a new key

Open your terminal and type


```bash
sentinelcli keys add <wallet_name>
```

You can create a new key with the name `default` as in the following example:

```bash
sentinelcli keys add default
```

<details><summary>Output</summary>
<p>

#### This is the output of `sentinelcli add key default`

```bash
- name: default
  type: local
  address: sent1706klv73nhw2k3p0yl3l88q9p6vlypudrk3nr7
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AxU17+KenLYWlmN50t+zDNvOz3YtzrBT6YwzGfi56Wvb"}'
  mnemonic: ""

**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

```

</p>
</details>

The key comes with a "mnemonic phrase", which is serialized into a human-readable 24-word mnemonic. User can recover their associated addresses with the mnemonic phrase.

:::danger
It is important that you keep the mnemonic for address secure, as there is **no way** to recover it. You would not be able to recover and access the funds in the wallet if you forget the mnemonic phrase.
:::

## Restore existing key by seed phrase

If you already have a seed phrase, use the `--recover` flag after the command:

```bash
sentinelcli keys add default_restore --recover
```

You will be prompet to type your mnemonic

```bash
> Enter your bip39 mnemonic
## Enter your 24-word mnemonic here ##
```

## List your keys

If you already have one or more keys, use the following command to list them:

```bash
sentinelcli keys list
```

Multiple keys can be created when needed. You can list all keys saved under the storage path.

<p>

#### This is the output of `sentinelcli add key default`

```bash
- name: default
  type: local
  address: sent13zzgfl5n05tk97sq7xdgvx5zmfhx6undyw8722
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A6oQhw7UBXp98BxGq8n638dkkYxDhLXHlIsWTdvibY70"}'
  mnemonic: ""
- name: default_recover
  type: local
  address: sent1tsefn9fs66gzjzuld0lf402t6p5rhgwcntzahs
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A0N2NsaJVu4i11jBeoVMvSFDqoGi2nDcJlplMUF9BVS1"}'
  mnemonic: ""
```

</p>
</details>

## Retrieve key information

If you want to view the details of one of your keys, type this command:

```bash
sentinelcli keys show <key_name>
```

You will get the same output as of the first example where we created the key.

## Delete a key

If you want to delete one of your keys, type this command:

```bash
sentinelcli keys delete <key_name>
```

You will get the following prompt:

```bash
Key reference will be deleted. Continue? [y/N]: y
Key deleted forever (uh oh!)
```

:::danger
Make sure you have backed up the key mnemonic before removing any of your keys, as there will be no way to recover your key without the mnemonic.
:::

## Export private keys

If you want to export and backup one of your keys, type the following command:

```bash
sentinelcli keys export <key_name>
```

You will get the following prompt:

```bash
Enter passphrase to encrypt the exported key: ## Insert passphrase (must be at least 8 characters)##
-----BEGIN TENDERMINT PRIVATE KEY-----
kdf: bcrypt
salt: ## Salt of the key ##
type: secp256k1

-----END TENDERMINT PRIVATE KEY-----
```

## The keyring-backend option

Interacting with a node requires a public-private key pair. A keyring is the container that holds these keys, which can be stored in various locations, each with a specified backend type.

```
sentinelcli keys [subcommands] --keyring-backend [backend type]
```
### Os backend

The default `os` backend stores the keys in operating system's credential subsystem, which is convenient for most users without compromising on security. 

Here is a list of password managers corresponding to different operating systems:
- macOS (since Mac OS 8.6): [Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keychain-access/welcome/mac)
- Windows: [Credentials Management API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/credentials-management)
- GNU/Linux:
  - [libsecret](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret)
  - [kwallet](https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kwallet/html/index.html)

### File backend

The `file` backend stores the encrypted keys inside the app's configuration directory. A password entry is required everytime a user access it, which may also result in multiple repeated password prompts in a single command.

### Test backend

The `test` backend is a password-less variation of the `file` backend. It stores unencrypted keys inside the app's configuration directory and should only be used in testing environments. It should never be used in production.
