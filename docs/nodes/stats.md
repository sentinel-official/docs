- [Busurnode](https://sentinel.busurnode.com/): this tool assists node hosts in obtaining information about their nodes' health check status. In case of failure, it provides details about what might have gone wrong.
- [Node Faucet](https://faucet.im/): To kickstart your node, ensure your operator address has sufficient DVPN. For testing, use the Sentinel Node Faucet by entering your node operator address.
