# RPC List

Because dVPN Nodes rely on RPC Nodes to connect to the blockchain, it's crucial for these RPC Nodes to:
- Perform efficiently
- Have reliable uptime.

Additionally, dVPN Node owners should select an RPC Node that's nearby to ensure a reliable connection and low latency.

You can find an up-to-date list of public RPC Nodes at this link: https://sentnodes.com/public-rpc. It's also advisable to use RPC Nodes that offer load balancing, which distributes requests across multiple sub Full Nodes.

You can also find more RPC Nodes at https://cosmos.directory/sentinel/nodes, which have been collected from the [Sentinel Chain Registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/sentinel/chain.json). However, we recommend using the first link as it's generally better maintained and kept up to date.
