# Tendermint Metrics

## Validator Machine

Execute the following operations on your validator machine

Tendermint Metrics can be enabled by simply editing your validator `config.toml` file.

Open your config file

```bash
sudo nano /home/<your-user>/.sentinelhub/config/config.toml
```

Edit the followinf fields like below

```bash
prometheus = true
prometheus_listen_addr = :26660
```

Save the file and restart your validator

You can verify that `metrics` are being exported by cURLing the /metrics endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:26660/metrics
```

Success! Tendermint Metrics is now exposing metrics that Prometheus can scrape, including a wide variety of system metrics further down in the output.

:::danger Important
After successfully enabling Tendermint Metrics, the next step is to open port 26660 on your Validator's firewall. This port should be accessible exclusively from your monitoring machine. This action is essential to enable Prometheus to collect data from Tendermint Metrics.

```bash
sudo ufw allow from monitor_ip to validator_ip port 26660
```

## Add the Job to Prometheus Config file

On your monitoring machine, go to your prometheus directory and open your `prometheus.yml` file

```bash
sudo nano prometheus.yml
```

Add the validator metrics job into it, under `scrape_configs` block

```bash
# Validator Metrics
  - job_name: "validator-metrics"
â€‹
    # validator ip and port
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["validator_ip:26660"]
```
